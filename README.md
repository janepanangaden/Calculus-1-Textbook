I am currently building a textbook to accompany my Ma030: Calculus 1 course at Pitzer College. New versions will be uploaded here during the Fall 2024 term.

This work is not currently licensed. Please do not distribute it or remix it while it is under construction. The first version will be shared with the community under an open license when it is completed.
